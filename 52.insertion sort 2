Question 1: Handling Duplicates in Insertion Sort

Describe how Insertion Sort manages arrays with duplicate elements during the sorting process. Explain the algorithm's behavior when encountering duplicate values, including whether it preserves the relative order of duplicates and how it affects the overall sorting outcome. Provide specific examples with arrays containing duplicate integers, demonstrating how Insertion Sort sorts the array while ensuring duplicates are correctly positioned, and discuss any considerations or adjustments that might be necessary.

def insertionsort(a):
    n=len(a)
    for i in range(1,n):
        temp=a[i]
        j=i-1;
        while(j>=0 and a[j]>temp):
            a[j+1]=a[j]
            j=j-1
        a[j+1]=temp
    return a
a=list(map(int,input("enter the array :").split()))
res=insertionsort(a)
print("sorted array :",res)
